# Portfolio
Hello, my name is Daria. I am a beginner manual tester with first comercial experience in testing web and mobile applications. Currently I am studying the JavaScript language.  In the future, I intend to invest my time in learning test automation, Python language, as well as learning how to use artificial intelligence in tester’s work, such as for test automation. My plan for developing is to take part in internships, open sources and meet ups in the close feature.

I consider myself a well developed person with soft skills. Communication is a skill that I have been actively developing for several years, but also one that I want to enhance further. Learning foreign languages, communication techniques and empathy are my strong points. I am a positive person with a lot of energy to act. I am aware of my weaknesses and I am focused on working at them. 
I am interested in technological innovations, making videos and traveling. My priority is professional and personal growth.I love learning new things and I don’t want to stop in this process.
