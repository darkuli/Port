Hello, my name is Daria. I am a beginner manual tester with first comercial experience in testing web and mobile applications. Currently I am studying the JavaScript language.  In the future, I intend to invest my time in learning test automation, Python language, as well as learning how to use artificial intelligence in testerâ€™s work, such as for test automation. My plan for developing is to take part in internships, open sources and meet ups in the close feature.

I consider myself a well developed person with soft skills. Communication is a skill that I have been actively developing for several years, but also one that I want to enhance further. Learning foreign languages, communication techniques and empathy are my strong points. I am a positive person with a lot of energy to act. I am aware of my weaknesses and I am focused on working at them.
